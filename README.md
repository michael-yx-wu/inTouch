inTouch

Inspiring genuine connections

Git may not correctly copy over the build number incrementing script. In which
case, in Xcode, select the inTouch target, click on build phases, and paste the
code from this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/michael-yx-wu/121c2ea32f71ab94e07c) into the
"run script" section.
